# sqlalchemy-challenge

The goal of this challenge is to do a climate analysis about Hawaii area. The main metrics for the climate analysis are: Precipitation and Temperature.

In this repository you can find the 'climate_starter' jupyter notebook where you can extract information from hawaii sqlite database (which is located inside resources folder) in order to analyze some relevant metrics, for example: precipitation and temperature data for one year (2016-08-23 to 2017-08-23). Also you will see some charts that show the measure of the precipitation in Hawaii for that particular year and a histogram of the temperature in one of the most active stations.

To complement this project you can find inside the SurfsUp folder an app.py file, which is an API built with the micro-framework 'Flask' and the 'jsonify' library to retrieve the information from the queries performed in our analysis on a JSON format. With this, any client or customer can easily access to this information using their own web browser, just by copy/paste the routes provided in the home page.

To replicate this analysis and explore the results just download this repository to your computer and start running the application and the jupyter notebook.
